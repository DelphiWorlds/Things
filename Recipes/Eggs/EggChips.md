# Egg chips

### Ingredients:

- 4 large eggs
- A pinch of salt (about 1/4 teaspoon or 1.25 ml)
- Optional: black pepper, garlic powder, or other herbs and spices for flavor

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Set your oven to 150°C (300°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat for easy removal of the chips.

2. **Separate the Eggs**: Carefully separate the egg whites from the yolks. You'll only be using the egg whites for this recipe. The yolks can be reserved for another use.

3. **Whip the Egg Whites**: In a clean, dry bowl, whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they form stiff peaks. This means when you lift your beaters or whisk out of the whites, the peaks should stand straight up without collapsing.

4. **Season the Egg Whites**: Gently fold in any additional seasonings you desire, being careful not to deflate the egg whites.

5. **Shape the Chips**: Using a spoon, dollop small, even amounts of the whipped egg whites onto the prepared baking sheet. Gently spread each dollop into a thin, chip-like shape.

6. **Bake**: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 20 to 30 minutes, or until the chips are crispy and slightly golden. 

7. **Cool and Serve**: Allow the egg chips to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes to crisp up further. Once cooled, carefully remove them from the baking sheet.

### Notes:

- **Watch Carefully**: Keep a close eye on the chips while they are baking to prevent over-browning.
- **Storing**: These chips are best enjoyed fresh, as they lose their crispiness over time. If you need to store them, keep them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a day.
- **Serving Suggestion**: Egg chips can be enjoyed on their own or with a dip like guacamole or a carnivore-friendly spread.
