# Liverwurst

### Ingredients:
- 900 grams pork liver (or a combination of beef and pork liver)
- 450 grams fatty pork belly or pork shoulder
- 15-30 grams salt (adjust to taste)
- 5 grams freshly ground black pepper
- 2.5 grams ground allspice (optional)
- 2.5 grams dried marjoram (optional)
- 60 grams finely chopped fresh onion (optional for a hint of natural sweetness and flavor)
- Cold water or broth for poaching

### Instructions:

1. **Preparation**: Rinse the liver under cold water to remove any blood or impurities. Trim any connective tissue or tough parts from the liver.

2. **Grinding the Meat**: Cut the liver and pork belly or shoulder into chunks that will fit into a meat grinder. Grind all the meat using a medium-fine disk into a large mixing bowl. If you don't have a grinder, you can also use a food processor, but ensure not to over-process; it should retain a bit of texture.

3. **Seasoning**: Add salt, pepper, allspice, marjoram, and chopped onion to the ground meat and mix thoroughly. It's essential to ensure that the seasonings are distributed evenly.

4. **Cooking**: 
   - Fill a large pot with cold water or broth and bring to a gentle simmer.
   - Shape the liverwurst mixture into logs or the shape of your container. If you're planning to store in a container that doubles as a mould, you can press the mixture directly into it.
   - Gently place the liverwurst into the simmering water or broth. Poach for about 1 hour. Ensure that the liverwurst is always covered with liquid; you may need to top up with hot water as it cooks.
   - To test for doneness, you can insert a meat thermometer into the center of the liverwurst. It should read at least 70Â°C.

5. **Cooling and Storing**: Once cooked, remove the liverwurst from the water and allow it to cool to room temperature. If you used a mould, let it cool inside the mould. Once cooled, transfer to the refrigerator and let it set and chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.

6. **Serving**: Liverwurst can be sliced and eaten as is, or spread on bread or crackers. 

This liverwurst should be stored in the refrigerator and consumed within a week. If you're planning to store it longer, consider freezing it. Before serving from the freezer, allow it to thaw in the refrigerator.
