# Biltong

**Ingredients:**

- Lean cuts of beef (e.g., top round, silverside) - 0.9-1.4 kg (2-3 pounds)
- Marinade (as per [this recipe](../Marinades/BiltongRegularMarinade.md))
- Coarse salt for coating

**Equipment:**

- A dehydrator
- Sharp knife for slicing meat
- Mixing bowl
- Airtight container for marinating
- Paper towels

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Meat:**
   - Start by selecting lean cuts of beef. Trim away any visible fat.
   - Slice the meat into strips or chunks, about 1-2 cm (1/2 to 3/4 inch) thick. You can slice them with the grain for a chewier texture or against the grain for a more tender biltong.

2. **Prepare the Marinade:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine the apple cider vinegar, water, dehydrated garlic, black pepper, paprika, and any additional spices you'd like to use. Stir well to ensure all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed.

3. **Marinate the Meat:**
   - Place the meat strips or chunks in an airtight container or a zip-top plastic bag.
   - Pour the marinade over the meat to ensure it's fully submerged. Seal the container or bag and refrigerate.
   - Allow the meat to marinate for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight in the refrigerator. This allows the flavors to penetrate the meat.

4. **Remove from Marinade:**
   - Take the marinated meat out of the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature. Drain the excess marinade and pat the meat dry with paper towels.

5. **Coat with Salt:**
   - Generously coat the meat with coarse salt. The salt helps to draw out moisture and preserve the biltong.

6. **Prepare the Dehydrator:**
   - Preheat your dehydrator to a temperature between 35-45°C (95-113°F). Biltong is traditionally dried at low temperatures to maintain its texture and flavor.

7. **Hang the Meat:**
   - Hang the salted meat strips or chunks on the racks or hooks in your dehydrator, leaving some space between each piece to ensure proper airflow. You can use S-hooks or similar to hang them.

8. **Dehydrate:**
   - Let the meat dehydrate in the dehydrator for 24 to 48 hours or until it reaches your desired level of dryness. The drying time can vary based on the thickness of the meat, humidity, and the dehydrator's temperature.

9. **Check for Doneness:**
   - To check if the biltong is done, remove a piece and cut it in half. It should be dry on the outside but still slightly moist inside. It should have a chewy texture, not completely brittle.

10. **Store Biltong:**
    - Once the biltong has reached your preferred level of dryness, remove it from the dehydrator and let it cool to room temperature.
    - Store the biltong in an airtight container or vacuum-sealed bags to maintain its freshness.

Your homemade biltong is now ready to enjoy as a flavorful, protein-packed snack! Remember that biltong can be stored for several weeks or even longer if kept in a cool, dry place.
