# Meat "Bread"

### Ingredients:

- 500 grams of ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork)
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of salt
- 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of black pepper
- Optional: herbs and spices such as garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, or Italian seasoning for added flavor

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. **Mix Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, eggs, salt, pepper, and any additional herbs or spices you prefer. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.

3. **Shape the Meat**: Transfer the meat mixture to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Shape it into a loaf or a bread-like shape. You can use a bread loaf pan to help maintain the shape.

4. **Bake**: Place the shaped meat in the preheated oven. Bake for about 45 to 55 minutes, or until the meat is thoroughly cooked. The internal temperature should reach at least 75°C (165°F) when checked with a meat thermometer.

5. **Cool and Slice**: Once baked, remove the meat bread from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Transfer it to a cutting board and slice it like bread.

6. **Serving Suggestions**: Serve the meat bread slices as you would with regular bread – you can use them for sandwiches, or eat them plain with a side of vegetables or salad for a more balanced meal.

### Notes:

- **Variations**: Feel free to add finely minced vegetables like onions or bell peppers into the mix for additional flavor and texture, keeping in mind that this will deviate from a strict carnivore diet.
- **Storage**: Leftover meat bread can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days.
