# Duck Liver Pâté

This recipe is very similar to the [Beef Or Lamb Pâté](BeefOrLambPate.md), other than the method and timing of cooking the liver

**Ingredients:**
1. 450g duck liver, cleaned and thinly sliced
2. 1 medium onion, finely chopped
3. 2 cloves garlic, minced
4. 115g unsalted butter, divided
5. 60ml heavy cream or crème fraîche (optional for smoother texture)
6. 30ml brandy or cognac (optional)
7. 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
8. Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
9. 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)
10. 15g fresh parsley, chopped
11. 1 tablespoon capers, rinsed (optional)
12. 15-30ml olive oil or melted butter for sealing (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preparation of Liver:** Rinse the duck liver slices under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Remove any connective tissue or membranes.

2. **Cook the Liver:** In a large skillet, melt half of the butter over medium heat. Once hot, add the duck liver slices, cooking each side for 1-2 minutes or until browned but still slightly pink in the center. Remove the liver from the skillet and set aside.

3. **Sauté Onions and Garlic:** In the same skillet, add the chopped onion. Sauté until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

4. **Deglaze the Pan:** If using brandy or cognac, pour it into the skillet now. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Allow the alcohol to cook off, about 1-2 minutes.

5. **Blend:** Transfer the cooked liver, sautéed onion, garlic, and all pan juices to a food processor. Add the remaining butter, thyme, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and heavy cream or crème fraîche (if using). Process until the mixture is smooth and creamy.

6. **Final Touches:** Add the chopped parsley and capers, if using. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.

7. **Transfer and Seal:** Place the pâté into a serving dish or ramekin. To seal and preserve, pour a thin layer of olive oil or melted butter over the top, creating a seal to keep the pâté fresh.

8. **Refrigerate:** Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the pâté to firm up.

9. **Serve:** Enjoy the pâté with toasted bread, crackers, or sliced vegetables. 

Store leftovers in the refrigerator and use within a week, ensuring to always use a clean utensil to serve and maintain freshness.
