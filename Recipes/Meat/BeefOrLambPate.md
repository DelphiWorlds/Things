# Beef or Lamb Liver Pâté

This recipe is very similar to the [Duck Pâté](DuckPate.md), other than the method and timing of cooking the liver

**Ingredients:**
1. 450g beef or lamb liver, cleaned and thinly sliced
2. 1 medium onion, finely chopped
3. 2 cloves garlic, minced
4. 115g unsalted butter, divided
5. 60ml heavy cream or crème fraîche (optional for smoother texture)
6. 2 tablespoons (30ml) brandy or cognac (optional)
7. 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
8. Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
9. 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)
10. A handful of fresh parsley, chopped (about 15g)
11. 1 tablespoon capers, rinsed (optional, for a touch of tang)
12. 15-30ml olive oil or melted butter for sealing (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preparation of Liver:** Begin by rinsing the liver slices under cold water. Pat them dry with paper towels. Remove any connective tissue or membranes.

2. **Cook the Liver:** In a large skillet, melt half of the butter over medium heat. Once the butter is foaming, add the sliced liver to the pan. Cook each side for about 2 minutes or until browned but still slightly pink in the center. Remove the liver from the skillet and set it aside.

3. **Sauté Onions and Garlic:** In the same skillet, add the chopped onion. Sauté until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

4. **Deglaze the Pan:** If you're using brandy or cognac, pour it into the skillet now. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Allow the alcohol to cook off, about 1-2 minutes.

5. **Blend:** Transfer the cooked liver, onion, garlic, and all the pan juices to a food processor. Add the remaining butter, thyme, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and heavy cream or crème fraîche (if using). Process until the mixture is smooth and creamy.

6. **Final Touches:** Stir in the chopped parsley and capers, if using. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.

7. **Transfer and Seal:** Transfer the pâté into a serving dish or ramekin. To seal and preserve the pâté, you can pour a thin layer of olive oil or melted butter over the top. This creates a seal to help keep the pâté fresh.

8. **Refrigerate:** Cover the pâté with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the pâté to firm up.

9. **Serve:** Enjoy the pâté on toasted bread, crackers, or with sliced vegetables. 

Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to a week. Always use a clean utensil to serve to keep the pâté from spoiling. If you're looking for a firmer texture, there are a few natural adjustments you can make:

1. **Reduce or Omit Cream:** The heavy cream or crème fraîche contributes to a creamier texture. For a firmer result, you can reduce the amount or omit it entirely.

2. **Increase Butter:** Butter solidifies when chilled, so using more butter can help firm up the pâté. If you decide to omit the cream, consider adding a bit more butter.

3. **Gelatin:** A natural way to firm up pâté is by using unflavored gelatin. Here's how you can incorporate it:

   - Dissolve 1-2 teaspoons of unflavored gelatin in 2-3 tablespoons of cold water.
   - Let it sit for a few minutes until it becomes spongy.
   - Warm it gently (either in a microwave or over a water bath) until dissolved but not boiling.
   - Blend this gelatin mixture into the liver mixture during the blending step.

When refrigerated, the gelatin will help set the pâté and give it a firmer texture.

4. **Cooking Time:** Overcooking liver can make it firmer (though potentially a bit grainy). You can cook the liver slices a little longer if you prefer a denser texture, but be cautious not to overdo it as the liver can become tough.

5. **Eggs:** Some traditional pâté recipes incorporate egg yolks to act as a binder and provide a firmer texture when cooked. If you want to use eggs:

   - Add 1-2 raw egg yolks during the blending process.
   - Once blended, transfer the mixture back to a pot and cook gently over low heat, stirring constantly until it thickens slightly. This cooking step is necessary to ensure the eggs are fully cooked.

Remember that adjustments might alter the flavor slightly, so always taste and adjust seasoning as necessary.
