# Cheese Crisps

### Ingredients:

- 100 grams of cheese (Cheddar, Parmesan, Asiago, or any hard, aged cheese works well)

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat Oven**: Set your oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. **Prepare the Cheese**: Choose a hard, aged cheese for the best results. Parmesan, Asiago, or aged Cheddar are excellent choices. Grate the cheese or slice it thinly.

3. **Make Cheese Piles**: Place small heaps of the cheese (about a tablespoon each) on the baking sheet. Make sure to leave enough space between each pile, as they will spread out while baking.

4. **Flatten the Piles**: Slightly flatten each pile with the back of a spoon or your fingers. This helps them cook evenly and get crispy.

5. **Bake**: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake for about 5-7 minutes, or until the edges of the cheese crisps are golden brown.

6. **Cool and Remove**: Once baked, remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the crisps cool for a few minutes. They will crisp up further as they cool.

7. **Serve**: Once cooled, use a spatula to gently lift the cheese crisps off the parchment paper.

### Notes:

- **Watch Closely**: Keep a close eye on the crisps as they bake, as they can go from perfect to burnt very quickly.
- **Variations**: You can add seasonings like black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, or dried herbs to the cheese before baking for added flavor.
- **Storage**: Cheese crisps are best enjoyed fresh. However, you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two, but they may lose some of their crispiness.
