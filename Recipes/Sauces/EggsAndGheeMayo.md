# Eggs and Ghee Mayonnaise

**Ingredients:**

- 2 large eggs (approximately 120 grams each)
- 250 ml [OMGhee](https://omghee.com/) (ghee)
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar or lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, or to taste

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare Your Ingredients:**
   - Ensure that the eggs are at room temperature, as this will help the mayo emulsify better.
   - Ensure that the ghee is melted into liquid, but is still cool enough so that it does not cook the eggs
   - Measure out the ghee, Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar or lemon juice, salt, and white pepper.

2. **Separate the Eggs:**
   - Carefully separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. You will only need the yolks for this recipe. You can save the egg whites for another use.

3. **Blend Egg Yolks and Mustard:**
   - Place the egg yolks and Dijon mustard in a food processor or blender.

4. **Blend Egg Yolks and Mustard:**
   - Place the egg yolks and Dijon mustard in a food processor or blender.

5. **Slowly Add Ghee:**
   - Turn on the food processor or blender and start to blend the yolks and mustard mixture.
   - Slowly drizzle in the ghee in a thin, steady stream while the processor is running. This process should take about 1-2 minutes. The slow addition of ghee is crucial for proper emulsification.

6. **Add Vinegar or Lemon Juice:**
   - While the processor is still running, add the white wine vinegar or lemon juice. This will help balance the flavors and add acidity to the mayo.

7. **Season with Salt and Pepper:**
   - Stop the food processor and taste the mayonnaise. Add salt and white pepper to taste. Blend briefly to incorporate the seasoning.

8. **Check Consistency:**
   - If the mayonnaise is too thick for your liking, you can thin it out by adding a little more lemon juice or vinegar while the processor is running.

9. **Transfer and Store:**
   - Transfer the homemade mayonnaise to a clean, airtight container. Store it in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 weeks.

10. **Serve:**
    - Use your homemade mayonnaise as a delicious condiment for sandwiches, salads, or as a base for various dressings and sauces.
