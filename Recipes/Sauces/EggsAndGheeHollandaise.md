# Eggs and Ghee Hollandaise

**Ingredients:**

- 3 large egg yolks (approximately 55 grams each)
- 200 grams of ghee (clarified butter)
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- A pinch of cayenne pepper or a dash of hot sauce (optional, for a bit of heat)
- A pinch of white pepper (optional, for a milder flavor)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare a Double Boiler:**
   - Fill a small saucepan with a couple of inches of water and bring it to a gentle simmer over low heat. Place a heatproof bowl on top of the saucepan to create a double boiler. Make sure the bowl doesn't touch the simmering water.

2. **Whisk Egg Yolks:**
   - In the heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they are well combined and slightly thickened.

3. **Slowly Add Ghee:**
   - Begin adding the ghee to the egg yolks very slowly, whisking constantly. You want to add it in a thin, steady stream to create an emulsion.
   - Continue whisking and adding the ghee until you've incorporated all of it. This process should take a few minutes. The sauce will thicken as you go.

4. **Add Lemon Juice and Seasonings:**
   - Once all the ghee is incorporated and the sauce is thickened, remove the bowl from the heat.
   - Stir in the freshly squeezed lemon juice and season with salt. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning as needed.
   - If you like a bit of heat, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a dash of hot sauce. You can also add a pinch of white pepper for a milder flavor.

5. **Serve Immediately:**
   - Hollandaise sauce is best when served immediately. It pairs wonderfully with poached eggs, asparagus, or grilled vegetables.

6. **Store Any Leftovers:**
   - If you have any leftover Hollandaise sauce, you can store it in a covered container in the refrigerator for a short time. Reheat it gently over a double boiler when you're ready to use it again, adding a little warm water and whisking to bring it back to the desired consistency.
